## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/jobs/[id]` - Fetches job with applications and candidates
- `POST /api/jobs/[id]/candidates` - Adds candidates to job
- `GET /api/candidates` - Fetches all candidates for selection
- `POST /api/candidates` - Creates new candidates

### State Management
```typescript
// Modal states
const [showAddExistingModal, setShowAddExistingModal] = useState(false);
const [showCreateCandidateModal, setShowCreateCandidateModal] = useState(false);

// Callback handlers
const handleCandidateAdded = (newCandidate: any) => {
  // Add to local state and update counts
};

const handleCandidateCreated = (newCandidate: any) => {
  // Handle new candidate creation
};
```

### Component Integration
- **PipelineKanban**: Enhanced with AddCandidateComponent prop
- **CandidateDrawer**: Existing component for detailed candidate view
- **AddExistingCandidateModal**: Reused existing modal component
- **CreateCandidateModal**: Reused existing creation wizard
