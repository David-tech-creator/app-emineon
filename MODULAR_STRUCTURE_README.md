# Modular Competence File Creation Structure

## Overview
The large `CreateCompetenceFileModal.tsx` (3054 lines) has been refactored into smaller, maintainable components for better organization and reusability.

## New Modular Components

### 1. CandidateSelectionStep.tsx
**Features:**
- File upload support (CV/Resume parsing)
- Text input parsing
- LinkedIn URL parsing
- **NEW: Existing candidate database selection**
- Candidate preview display

**Key Functionality:**
- Integrates with `useCandidates` hook to fetch existing candidates
- Search and filter candidates from database
- Select existing candidate or upload new CV
- Real-time parsing with loading states

### 2. TemplateSelectionStep.tsx
**Features:**
- Template selection (Professional, Modern, Minimal, Emineon, Antaes)
- Document sections configuration
- Drag-and-drop section reordering
- Section visibility toggle
- Custom elements management

### 3. JobDescriptionStep.tsx
**Features:**
- Multi-input methods: Text, File upload, Voice recording
- AI-powered job description parsing
- Manager contact details collection
- Expandable job description preview

### 4. CreateCompetenceFileModalRefactored.tsx
**Main orchestrator component:**
- Step navigation (1-4)
- State management across steps
- Progress indicator
- Integration with all step components

## Benefits of Modular Structure

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to debug and test individual components
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Reusability**
- Steps can be reused in other workflows
- Components can be tested independently
- Easier to add new features

### 3. **Performance**
- Components can be lazy-loaded
- Smaller bundle sizes per component
- Better code splitting

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Easier to find specific functionality
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clearer code organization

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- [x] CandidateSelectionStep with existing candidate selection
- [x] TemplateSelectionStep with section management
- [x] JobDescriptionStep with multi-input support
- [x] Main refactored modal structure

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Integration with existing Lexical editor
- [ ] Complete state management between steps
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] Testing suite for modular components

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Complete Step 4 (Editor Integration)**
   - Integrate existing Lexical editor
   - Maintain auto-save functionality
   - Preserve AI enrichment features

2. **State Management**
   - Complete prop drilling or implement context
   - Add form validation between steps
   - Handle step-to-step data persistence

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for step flow
   - Performance optimization

4. **Migration Strategy**
   - Gradual replacement of monolithic component
   - Feature parity validation
   - User testing

## Key Features Added

### Existing Candidate Selection
- **Database Integration**: Fetches candidates from existing database
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time candidate search
- **Preview**: Shows candidate details before selection
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside file upload options

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: One step at a time
- **Clear Navigation**: Step indicators and navigation
- **Consistent UI**: Unified design across all steps
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Props Interface
Each step component has a well-defined props interface:
```typescript
interface StepProps {
  // Data props
  selectedData: DataType;
  onDataUpdate: (data: DataType) => void;
  
  // UI state props
  isLoading: boolean;
  
  // Action handlers
  onAction: () => void;
}
```

### State Management Pattern
- **Lifting State Up**: Main modal manages all state
- **Controlled Components**: Steps are controlled by parent
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for API failures
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages
- **Recovery Options**: Allow users to retry operations
